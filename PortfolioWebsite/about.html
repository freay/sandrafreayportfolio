         <h1>My Story. </h1>
            <p>I learned how to use a Singer sewing machine when I was 15. I took used leather skirts from the thrift store and would cut and sew them to make really unique, fun bags out of them. My peers and friends wer all the craze, and from that point on, I knew I had a natural talent to be creative and a deep curiosity to learn more about design.</p>
            <p>In 2009, I went to pursue my design dreams in New York City and graduated from
            <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/" target="_blank">The New School for Design at Parsons</a>.</p>
            <p>I have honed my Design Thinking skills by creating strategic solutions for designer bags and accessories for some of the world’s most recognizable brands</p>
            <p>Over the last 4 years I’ve evolved into a Entrepreneur, starting a small hangbags line   <a href="https://www.freay.com/" target="_blank">Mochila Mochila By Freay</a>, which preserves the craftmanship of indigenous women in Colombia.</p>
