            <h1>Case Study</h1>
            <h2> Torchy's Micro Site</h2>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Brief:</strong> Create an e-commerce micro site for Torchy’s brand.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> When looking over the Torchy’s website, we noticed they didn’t have vegan options, so we thought it would be a great idea to create an all plant-based menu to order online for the vegan community.</p>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Writing something here.</p>
        <p>Interview Stakeholder.</p>
        <p>Stakeholder goals: To reach a new market that will be profitable for the business and fits within the Torchy’s brand. Create a seamless checkout process. Start with a small menu.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Survey’s were posted to several Vegan Group pages online. 108 survey responses received.

        <p>6 user interviews were conducted.</p>

        <p>From all our data, this is what we found:
            <br>A majority of our respondents are female.
            <br>Vegans eat out often with non-vegans.
            <br>They rely heavily on group reviews to find places to eat.
            <br>They would like to see more vegan options at restaurants with customization on orders.</br>

        <p>We then took our survey and interview responses and mapped it out into an affinity diagram to better analyze our research.
